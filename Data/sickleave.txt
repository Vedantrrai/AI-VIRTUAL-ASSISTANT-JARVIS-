Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I am writing to inform you that, unfortunately, I will be unable to attend work for the next [number] days due to health reasons. I am currently unwell with [briefly mention the illness, e.g., fever, flu, etc.] and my doctor has advised me to take a period of rest to recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am able to return to the office. I will provide a medical certificate from my doctor, if required, to support my application for sick leave.

The details of my leave are as follows:
- Start Date: [Date]
- End Date: [Date]
- Number of days: [Number]

I would appreciate it if you could approve my application for sick leave. If there are any pressing matters that need my attention in the meantime, please let me know and I will do my best to address them remotely.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,
Siddhant
