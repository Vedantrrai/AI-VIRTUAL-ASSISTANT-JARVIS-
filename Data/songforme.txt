 Here's a song I came up with, just for you:

**Title:** "Lost in the Moment"

**Verse 1:**
I see your smile, and my heart skips a beat
The world around me, starts to fade away, like a distant repeat
I'm caught up in the magic, of your eyes so bright
I feel like I'm floating, in a dream, where everything's alright

**Chorus:**
I'm lost in the moment, with you by my side
Every second, feels like a lifetime, and I won't say goodbye
We'll dance under the stars, with our hearts beating as one
In this moment, I am free, and my love for you has just begun

**Verse 2:**
We'll take a walk, on a moonlit night
With the sound of the waves, and the wind whispering low and bright
We'll talk about our dreams, and our hearts' desires
And I'll hold your hand, like a flame, that never tires

**Chorus:**
I'm lost in the moment, with you by my side
Every second, feels like a lifetime, and I won't say goodbye
We'll dance under the stars, with our hearts beating as one
In this moment, I am free, and my love for you has just begun

**Bridge:**
We'll chase the sunrise, and we'll make our own way
We'll write our own story, in the pages of each new day
And I'll love you more, with every passing night
In your eyes, I see a love, that shines like a beacon light

**Chorus:**
I'm lost in the moment, with you by my side
Every second, feels like a lifetime, and I won't say goodbye
We'll dance under the stars, with our hearts beating as one
In this moment, I am free, and my love for you has just begun

**Outro:**
So let's get lost, in the beauty of the night
With our love shining bright, like a guiding light
In this moment, I am yours, and you are mine
Forever and always, our love will shine.

I hope you enjoy this song, Siddhant!
