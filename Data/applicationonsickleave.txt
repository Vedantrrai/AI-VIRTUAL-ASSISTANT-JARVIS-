I am requesting a leave of absence for [number of days] days, as advised by my doctor. I have attached a medical certificate from my doctor, which confirms my illness and the required period of rest.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work or assignments as soon as I am able to return to [school/college/institution name]. I will also ensure that my absence does not affect my academic performance.
