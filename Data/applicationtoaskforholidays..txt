Subject: Application for Holiday

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a holiday from [start date] to [end date] for a period of [number of days] days. I have a personal commitment that I need to attend to during this time and it is unavoidable.

I have checked the academic calendar and ensured that my request does not coincide with any important exams or critical assignments. I will make sure to complete all my pending work and assignments before taking the holiday, so my absence does not affect my academic performance.

I would like to request your approval for my holiday application. I will be available by email if any urgent matter arises during my absence. I will also ensure that I catch up on any missed work or assignments as soon as I return to [school/college/institution name].

I would greatly appreciate it if you could consider my application and grant me the holiday. If there is any additional information or documentation required, please let me know.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
